Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out. <br /><br />Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent. Very little music or anything to speak of. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head. He goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales clerks before they find the album. Cute scene gave promise, but it went downhill from there. The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty. Wasted two hours.\",\n          \"This movie accurately portrays the struggle life was for the typical East German. Watched by the secret police, friends and coworkers, most easterners simply existed.<br /><br />The Strelzyk's and the Wetzel's were two families that decided they weren't going to take it anymore. <br /><br />Despite the extreme danger involved in escaping to the West, they feel the rewards far outweighed the risks. John Hurt and Beau Bridges, portraying the respective family heads hit upon the idea of flying over East Germany's heavily fortified border. <br /><br />There are tense moments as they gather and jimmy-rig the necessary materials for the flight. They work their day jobs and construct the balloon at night, right under the noses of the authorities, one of whom is Strelzyk's neighbor (Klaus Loewitsch). <br /><br />The first attempt, involving only the Strelzyks, ends in failure when the balloon crashes just a few yards from the border. The crashed balloon is discovered by border guards and an relentless search begins for the conspirators who are determined to try again. With sales of materials being closely monitored Peter and Guenter still manage to procure bits and pieces of cloth with which to construct a second balloon for their nail biting escape to freedom. The film also features a heartwarming and effective soundtrack by the late Jerry Goldsmith.\",\n          \"This 1973 TV remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original. Surprise!<br /><br />First, the good things. Lee J. Cobb makes a terrific Barton Keyes. He's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but he's the only reason to watch this. This remake's only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of Lola Dietrichson, the step-daughter of the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson.<br /><br />And that's it for the good things.<br /><br />The bad things are many. The director records everything in an indifferent manner: if you watched the film with the sound muted you'd hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening. Because of modern bad taste, the film must be in color instead of black and white. Because of 1970s bad taste, all the sets are distractingly ugly. Walter Neff's expensive apartment, in particular, is hideous.<br /><br />The modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways. Train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s, so Mr. Dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance. Men stopped wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white-haired Mr. Dietrichson. Women in mourning stopped wearing veils, which robs Samantha Eggar of a prop Barbara Stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene. (Oddly, Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them.)<br /><br />Stephen Bochco keeps much of the Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler script the same. But he makes a lot of tiny, inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular. Outrageously, the famous motorcycle-cop banter is gone, but look closely and you'll see what looks like a post-production cut where those lines should have been. Bochco may not be to blame.<br /><br />Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff. What might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead we get Samantha Eggar, who comes off like a standard-issue villainess from \\\"Barnaby Jones.\\\" But who can blame Eggar? With a director who barely seems interested in what's happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck herself have come off well?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Converting into Lower Case**"],"metadata":{"id":"-7mrR3BP6U9_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['review'][3]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":90},"id":"-Bpc12Q55vq4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749615137932,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":112,"user":{"displayName":"Satish naidu Vulli","userId":"01361632804568797282"}},"outputId":"d53a43f5-3924-4327-d1c1-cdff9bdcc701"},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"Basically there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.<br /><br />This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie.<br /><br />OK, first of all when you're going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama!

with a director who barely seems interested in what's happening in front of the camera, how could barbara stanwyck herself have come off well?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Remove URLs**"],"metadata":{"id":"ILOTapVs7yqn"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def remove_url(text):\n","  pattern = re.compile(r'https?://\\S+|www\\.\\S+')\n","  return pattern.sub(r'', text)"],"metadata":{"id":"wDduZ6ej8_T7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749615146664,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Satish naidu Vulli","userId":"01361632804568797282"}}},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text1 = \"For more design inspiration, visit https://dribbble.com.\"\n","text2 = \"Visit our portfolio at https://satishnaidu.dev for more details.\"\n","text3 = \"Google search here www.google.com.\"\n","text4 = \"I uploaded the project to GitHub: https://github.com/username/project-name.\""],"metadata":{"id":"BCyBH1p17uA5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749615147392,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Satish naidu Vulli","userId":"01361632804568797282"}}},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["remove_url(text1)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"YUFqFd7-9RYL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749615148070,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":52,"user":{"displayName":"Satish naidu Vulli","userId":"01361632804568797282"}},"outputId":"d888228a-1971-4421-d37f-ec82fbb0ba3e"},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'For more design inspiration, visit '"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["remove_url(text2)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"8VZBG6AG9VyR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749615148502,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Satish naidu Vulli","userId":"01361632804568797282"}},"outputId":"7b485534-e0d1-45e0-c219-03393832fa0c"},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Visit our portfolio at  for more details.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['review'] = df['review'].apply(remove_url)"],"metadata":{"id":"KVktC9649ar0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749615149670,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":230,"user":{"displayName":"Satish naidu Vulli","userId":"01361632804568797282"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Remove Punctuation**"],"metadata":{"id":"KbWMJRIF98tM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import string\n","import time\n","string.punctuation"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"k-PPpkNb92y9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749615150719,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":25,"user":{"displayName":"Satish naidu Vulli","userId":"01361632804568797282"}},"outputId":"de7cce9a-21e8-4232-b8ea-8a529bd4695c"},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'!\"#$%&\\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\\\]^_`{|}~'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["exclude = string.punctuation"],"metadata":{"id":"GBWjj-3l-w0K","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749615151513,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Satish naidu Vulli","userId":"01361632804568797282"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# step-1\n","def remove_punc(text):\n","  for char in exclude:\n","    text = text.replace(char, '')\n","  return text"],"metadata":{"id":"KQCziDfa-z0V","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749615152399,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Satish naidu Vulli","userId":"01361632804568797282"}}},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = 'string.

the movie disappointed  became even more ridiculous  as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent very little music or anything to speak of the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head he goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales clerks before they find the album cute scene gave promise but it went downhill from there the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty wasted two hours\",\n          \"this movie accurately portrays the struggle life was for the typical east german watched by the secret police friends and coworkers most easterners simply existedrrthe strelzyks and the wetzels were two families that decided they werent going to take it anymore rrdespite the extreme danger involved in escaping to the west they feel the rewards far outweighed the risks john hurt and beau bridges portraying the respective family heads hit upon the idea of flying over east germanys heavily fortified border rrthere are tense moments as they gather and jimmyrig the necessary materials for the flight they work their day jobs and construct the balloon at night right under the noses of the authorities one of whom is strelzyks neighbor klaus loewitsch rrthe first attempt involving only the strelzyks ends in failure when the balloon crashes just a few yards from the border the crashed balloon is discovered by border guards and an relentless search begins for the conspirators who are determined to try again with sales of materials being closely monitored peter and guenter still manage to procure bits and pieces of cloth with which to construct a second balloon for their nail biting escape to freedom the film also features a heartwarming and effective soundtrack by the late jerry goldsmith\",\n          \"this 1973 tv remake of the billy wilder classic is inferior to the original surpriserrfirst the good things lee j cobb makes a terrific barton keyes hes not as good as edward g robinson of course but hes the only reason to watch this this remakes only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of lola dietrichson the stepdaughter of the femme fatale phyllis dietrichsonrrand thats it for the good thingsrrthe bad things are many the director records everything in an indifferent manner if you watched the film with the sound muted youd hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening because of modern bad taste the film must be in color instead of black and white because of 1970s bad taste all the sets are distractingly ugly walter neffs expensive apartment in particular is hideousrrthe modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s so mr dietrichsons decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance men stopped wearing hats which prevents walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the whitehaired mr dietrichson women in mourning stopped wearing veils which robs samantha eggar of a prop barbara stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene oddly lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of themrrstephen bochco keeps much of the billy wilderraymond chandler script the same but he makes a lot of tiny inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular outrageously the famous motorcyclecop banter is gone but look closely and youll see what looks like a postproduction cut where those lines should have been bochco may not be to blamerrrichard crenna is passable as walter neff what might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid phyllis dietrichson instead we get samantha eggar who comes off like a standardissue villainess from barnaby jones but who can blame eggar with a director who barely seems interested in whats happening in front of the camera how could barbara stanwyck herself have come off well\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":
