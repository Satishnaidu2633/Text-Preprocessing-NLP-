# 📚 Text Preprocessing on IMDB Dataset (NLP Project)

This project demonstrates key **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques by performing **text preprocessing** on the **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset**. The goal is to clean and transform raw textual data into a form suitable for machine learning and NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, classification, and more.

## 📂 Dataset

- **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset**
- Consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.
- Widely used for sentiment analysis and text classification tasks.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NLTK
- spaCy
- TextBlob
- re (Regular Expressions)
- emoji
- string

---

## 🔧 Preprocessing Tasks

The notebook includes step-by-step implementation of the following tasks:

- ✅ Converting text to lowercase
- ✅ Removing punctuation and special characters
- ✅ Removing URLs and emojis
- ✅ Tokenization
- ✅ Stopword removal
- ✅ Stemming (using NLTK)
- ✅ Lemmatization (using spaCy)
- ✅ Spelling correction (using TextBlob)
- ✅ Removing extra whitespace and digits

## 📈 Why Text Preprocessing?

Text data is often messy. Preprocessing ensures:

- Reduced noise and variability
- Better feature representation
- Improved model accuracy and generalization
- Efficient and faster training of NLP models

---

## 🧠 Applications

After preprocessing, the dataset becomes ready for downstream NLP tasks such as:

- Sentiment Analysis
- Text Classification
- Opinion Mining
- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
- Topic Modeling

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install nltk spacy textblob emoji
    python -m textblob.download_corpora
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```
3. Run the notebook `Text Preprocessing(NLP).ipynb` step-by-step.
4. Explore and customize preprocessing steps as per your NLP pipeline needs.
